<h3><span>About me</span></h3>
<body_aboutme>As you know by now, my name is Vasco Fernandes. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, speacializing in

  <br>I have been living in Sintra, a town 20 minutes from Lisbon, and in Dublin, Ireland. I lived in Dublin during last summer,
